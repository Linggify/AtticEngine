# AtticEngine
A little Game-Engine project

What attic is not:
-attic is not a 3D game engine
-attic does not aim to be the most performant 2D engine
-attic is not a low-level engine for developers who want 100% control over the rendering, or physics pipelines

What attic is:
-attic aims to be easy to use
-attic aims to deliver easy, yet powerful control over its rendering-pipeline, which uses a Node-based system to create complex RenderPaths
